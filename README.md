===============

Panda3D is an open source game engine. This project is about creating a
series of tutorials that provide a gentle enough entry to it for people
who already know Python. Here is a rough first outline...


Part 1
------

### History

Hi. So, what is Panda3D? In the 80s, Disney started experimenting with VR technology for its theme park rides....


### License

BSD-3 means what?


### Community

...and here's a whole bunch of websites to read about it, to get in contact with the community, or to throw money at Panda3D.
panda3d.org, Discourse, Discord, IRC, Twitter, Reddit, ...


Part 2
------

### Installation / Building

* `pip install panda3d`
* `git clone`
  `makepanda`


### Hello World & Deployment

import ShowBase; ShowBase(); base.run()
